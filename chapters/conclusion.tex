\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}


The BST is provided by M. Guigue and can be found on github \cite{mieuxdumonde}.
If you want a french bibliography you might need to modifiy the bst (change "and" into "et").

The style sheet was also proposed by Mathieu, but a similiar can be found online.
I also used Yunglong Jiao template to bring in modification to the original one \cite{yunglong_thesis}.
